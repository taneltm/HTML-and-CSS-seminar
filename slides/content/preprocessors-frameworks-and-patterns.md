## Preprocessors
Introducing extra functionality to CSS.  
Aiming for ease of use being more "programmer-friendly".  
- Nesting
- Variables
- Modular file system with imports
- Mixins, functions, loops
- ...

Notes:
- CSS can be a bit clunky to use.
- Basically a separate language, based on CSS but with improvements.
- Write your code in the preprocessor's language and it gets compiled into standard CSS.

<!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->
## Preprocessors
- SASS
- LESS
- Stylus

Notes:
- For anyone who writes CSS on a daily basis, these are a must. I love SASS.
- Functionality is slowly appearing in core CSS, maybe soon we won't need them?

## Methodologies
Front-end is subjective.  
Methologies mainly aim to create consistency code conventions.  
BEM vs Tailwind.
