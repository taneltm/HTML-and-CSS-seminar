Notes:
- It's a huge subject, might have to skip some slides, but link later
- The main idea behind this presentation is to:
  - Give a refresher on some basic topics, especially ones people tend to struggle with
  - Provide good practices and general mindset things regarding frontend dev
  - Introduce some useful new CSS features
  - Practice!
- Frontend dev is quite subjective
  - Lots of freedom, double-edged sword
  - Can be hard to enforce practices, even within one team
  - Different projects have different needs
  - People tend to not pay attention to it, but poor planning leads to issues later
- Let's get started!
